/**
 * A job may start multiple times, but only run exactly once to completion. It
 * can be serialized, and thus is persistent until finishing. Its behaviour
 * must be idempotent to avoid double-processing.
 *
 * <p>
 * Instances of this class are immutable, but can be copied and modified (using
 * {@link #toBuilder()}) and then saved, replacing the existing job.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The processing code is kept separate from the data.  The applicatiom will
 * inject an instance of {@link #processorFactory()} to create the processor
 * necessary to run the job.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * In a multi instance application, only one instance can lock and run the job
 * at a time. In the event of a failure of the instance holding the lock, the
 * lock will time out and get picked up by another instance.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Jobs are assumed to be asynchronous. They should return immediately on
 * startup and either subscribe to the necessary callbacks or spawn background
 * threads to achieve continuous processing.
